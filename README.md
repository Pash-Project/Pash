Status
------

**Alpha**. This project is useful in certain constrained applications, e.g. the [NuGet Console in Xamarin Studio](http://lastexitcode.com/blog/2014/06/22/NuGetPowerShellConsoleForXamarinStudio/).

Getting Started
---------------

<!-- Keep this in synch with CONTRIBUTING.md -->

Assuming you have MonoDevelop installed:

1. `git clone ...`
2. `cd Pash`
3. `xbuild`
4. `mono Source/PashConsole/bin/Debug/Pash.exe`

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details, especially if you see funny characters on startup.

License
-------

The original release of Pash in 2008 didn't include a LICENSE or COPYING file, or other indication of license. However, at [https://sourceforge.net/projects/pash/](http://web.archive.org/web/20121111142027/http://sourceforge.net/projects/pash/) it says:

> License
>
> BSD License, GNU General Public License (GPL)

I have emailed Igor Moochnick a few times to clarify his licensing intent, but he hasn't responded. So I'm treating that note on sourceforge as authoritative.


History
-------

Pash was created by Igor Moochnick and published at http://pash.sourceforge.net/ in 2008. After the original release, development ceased.

In 2012, Jay Bazuzi moved the project to GitHub and got things going again. A bunch of generous contributors have since joined in, keeping the project moving forward a bit at a time.
