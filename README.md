License
-------

The original release of Pash in 2008 didn't include a LICENSE or COPYING file, or other indication of license. However, at [https://sourceforge.net/projects/pash/](http://web.archive.org/web/20121111142027/http://sourceforge.net/projects/pash/) it says:

> License
> BSD License, GNU General Public License (GPL)

I have emailed Igor Moochnick a few times to clarify his licensing intent, but he hasn't responded. So I'm treating that note on sourceforge as authoritative.

History
-------

Pash was created by Igor Moochnick and published at http://pash.sourceforge.net/ in 2008. After the original release, development ceased.

In 2012, Jay Bazuzi started exploring the project to see what potential it held.
